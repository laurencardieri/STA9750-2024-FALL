My name is **Lauren** and I am *22 years old*. 


I am currently a student in Baruch's [MS Business Analytics Program](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/masters-in-business-analytics/).


### My Dogs!


I have two dogs! Their names are: 

1) Macaroni 

    - Macaroni (Mack) is technically my brother's dog, but we babysit him while he's at work. 
    
    
    - He is a Golden Retreiver and is 2 years old!

1) Rusty 

    - Rusty is extremely loving and the smartest dog I have ever met. 
    
    
    - He is a Pitbull/Lab mix and is 13 years old (we think, he's a rescue)!
