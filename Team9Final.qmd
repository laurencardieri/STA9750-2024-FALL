**How does county, income, and demographics affect mortgage loans and rates through the three stages of Covid (2018 - 2023)?**
</div>
--- 

## Introduction 

To combat rising inflation, it is no secret that mortgage rates have been climbing continuously, even surging to the highest it has been in decades. While the current rates are not the highest, as in 1981 the rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hit around 18.45%, our current rate of 7% - 8% is the highest it has been in recent years. Following the 2008 recession, mortgage rates hit a historic low of around 3% - 4%, dude to the Federal Reserve taking aggressive steps to stimulate the economy. This creates the question as to what happened within the last 16 years to cause this rise? 

We figured that the Covid-19 pandemic could have played a factor, but we were unsure if this was causation, *or* correlation that does not imply causation. Thus, this is the reasoning we picked the five years of data that we did. 

However, we also wanted to go on a more in-depth level. This is when we decided to see if income and demographics truly play a role in the mortgage rate bestowed upon you by the bank. We wanted to see if there was a true bias or if everyone was on the same playing field to begin. Choosing the geographic scale we wanted to asses our data on was difficult at first, as we originally intended to analyse this data on a borough level. After consideration, we realized we would have more data to draw conclusions basing our research on a New York State County level, which is the route we inevitably decided to go down. 

Finally, we decided our goal; we wanted to dive into the shift of mortgages Pre, During, and Post Pandemic based on the following three metrics: Geography, Demographics, and Economics. 

## Data Sources 

For our research, we decided on two major data sources to provide our information. They were the following: 

1. [Consumer Finance Protection Bureau- HMDA Data](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/)

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act allows for the data collection from financial institutions that disclose mortgage loan information. From this site, we retrieved the following data: year, interest rate, loan term, loan type, loan purpose, state code, county code, and much more. 


2. [United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/profile/New_York?g=040XX00US36)

The Census Bureau records data about people and its economy, and collects/records the data from a population. From this data, we retrieved data such as: income, employment, year, total income, industry, occupation, employment status, zip code, and much more. 

We used two files to get the necessary data we needed:


1. [S1901 Income in the Past 12 Months (in 2022 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars)](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S1901?q=Income%20by%20county&g=040XX00US36,36$0500000)


     - Income by household type: Family, Married, Nonfamily, etc.
     - Mean and Median income per household type
     - Estimate of how many people per $50,000 increments 
     
     
2. [S2401Occupation by Sex for the Civilian Employed Population 16 Years and Over](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S2401?q=Employment%20by%20county&g=040XX00US36,36$0500000)


     - Total employment per county in New York
     - Gives the population of each job type 

## Analytical Stage One 

To begin our analysis, we wanted to understand our data on a geographic level. Thus, we wanted to answer questions such as the following: 

1. What is the mean income amount by county? 
2. What is the total loan amount by county? 
3. What are the main jobs/occupations by county? 

With these three questions in mind, we began our analysis. From it, the following four graphs were created. 

### Mean Income Amount by County 
[![](https://i.postimg.cc/L64DnSXT/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/JtgZ29jD)

Above is a graph we derived that shows the mean income by county. The green bars represent the three highest counties and the red represents the three lowest. It is clear that the three top counties did not change overtime. For the converse, the lowest counties did change, but they remained consistent. 


### Total Loan Amount by County 
[![](https://i.postimg.cc/T3FJ7Wc7/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/21dW3yMh)
Above is a graph that shows the total loan amount by county. Similar to the prior graph, the green and red bars represent the same ideas. Here, we can see that beside the first year of 2018, the highest counties remained the same. On the other hand, while the lowest counties did not remain the same, they remained consistent. It is also important to notice that the counties that have the highest income from the last graph tend to have a higher total loan amount on this graph. The same can also be said about the lowest counties. 


### Total Loan Types Overtime 
[![](https://i.postimg.cc/BQgqBTJ3/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/HVrDp7Jv)
In this graph, the four types of loans are compared over the years, with lines representing the total from every county. Here, it can be seen that loan type 1 is *by far* the most frequent loan type of the four. We can also see that after the height of Covid struck in 2021, each loan type experienced a drop, with loan type one experiencing the most dramatic drop. 


### Occupation by County 
[![](https://i.postimg.cc/50v7qmdS/Occupations-graph.png)](https://postimg.cc/hzD1KTGX)

Above is a graph we derived from our data to show occupation by county. Interestingly enough, we can see that the "Management, Business, Science, Arts" category *dominated* the four other categories in every single county. 

### Overall Stage One Findings: 

1. Does the county you live in affect how much money you make? 

     Yes, the county you live in does affect how much you make, as some make progressively more than others
     
2. Does the mean income that a county makes correlate with the total amount of loans a county receives?

     Yes, they do correlate. The counties that tended to have lower mean incomes, had less total loans. The ones that had a higher mean income, had more total loans. 
     
3. Did any change occur with mean income and total loans before, during, and after COVID? 

     Mean income seemed to get higher after COVID in each county, while the Total Loans seemed to get lower. For both, the highest counties remained the same while the lowest counties varied throughout the years. 
     
4. Was there a loan type that prevailed over the others, and did the total loans given change overtime?

     Yes, Loan Type 1, Conventional Loans, was the highest in each county by far. After 2021, each loan type experienced a dramatic drop.
     
5. Was there a job category that prevailed in each county overtime?

     Yes, the Management, Business, Science, Art category prevailed in each county overtime by far.

## Analytical Stage Two

For Stage two analysis, we looked into demographics. We wanted to look into the data and confirm equity amongst races. It was no surprise to come across the results we did, however, we also had other factors to consider to fully conclude equity amongst races. Let’s look at the questions we performed data analysis to and the graphs created to depict data: 

### Loan Product Types by Race
1. What loan Type is most popular among race? Does one benefit more than others?  
[![](https://i.postimg.cc/nh3S2zsM/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/Bj1CQJBG)


From the data we gathered that the most popular loan was Conventional First Lien. Additionally, the races with greater loans per loan type are White, followed by Asians, followed by Black or African Americans. This holds true throughout the three stages of the pandemic, although max dollar distribution was during years 2020 -2021, and lowest post pandemic. 


### Total Loan Amount by Race 
2. Who has the greatest loan $ by race? Does one benefit more than others?

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/9Qg1TnS7/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/zyWnY0qz)

From the data we gathered that the greatest dollar loans start at White, followed by Asian, followed by Black/African America,  followed by 2 or more minority races , and American Indian/Alaskan Native being at lowest dollar loans. A pattern seen throughout the three stages of the pandemic. Also important to highlight, White race received more than double the total dollars loaned in comparison to other races through all three stages of the pandemic.


### Average Percentage Interst Rate by Race 
3. What are the interest rates by race? Does one benefit more than the others? 

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/rsT9MXdv/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/9Rx9YkYp)

     
From the data we gathered the races that benefited with lowest rates were Asian, followed by White, followed by Black/African American. In contrast, the races with highest rates went to Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and 2 or more minority races. In addition to this, in the year 2021 the data shows us that although interest rates dropped sharply, it is the point where max equity is witnessed, where almost all races had about/close to the same rates.

### Average Income Distribution by Race: Thousand $ 
4. What are the average income distributions by race? Does one benefit more than the others? 

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/Gmtxcj2h/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/zymg7KK9)


The data shows us that the highest average income distribution Pre-Pademic went to 2 or more minority races, followed by  White, followed by Asian. During the pandemic we see two different shifts happened in 2020 the highest income distribution went to Black/African American, followed by, followed by Asian. By 2021 the second shift happened where the highest average income distribution went to White, Asian, and two or more minority races. Finally post pandemic, specifically in 2022 the highest distribution went to Asian, followed by White, followed by American Indian and Alaskan Native. However, in 2023 the highest distribution went to American Indian and Alaskan Native. With so many shifts and shocking results here, it begged the questions why? From a raw data and numbers perspective, one can assume there exists highly skewed numbers, but what to do with these numbers? Additionally it leads to wonder, perhaps numbers were not following the correct format, maybe human error in data input, or error while data rendering at reporting. Whichever the case, it is difficult for an analyst to remove such numbers as verification of its existence or confirmation of error must be done, as this was the final data shared/distributed to HMDA by Financial Institutions. 

### Overall Stage Two Findings: 
Overall we see that the highest benefited race in mortgage dollars length and types of loans is White at a more than twice the distribution than any other races. Additionally, we see that the lowest mortgage rates benefit went to the Asian race, with an exception for 2021 where we see highest equity amongst all races. However, for average income distribution we don’t see a clear beneficial race, it looks like pre, during and post pandemic the distributions vary, leading to question the accuracy of the data. To conclude this analysis, based on the metrics analyzed there is a lot of work to be done in terms of equability by race. We do see an example in 2021 where that can be achieved, looking back at history when NY was going through the COVID19 lock-down. It leads to the question, does equability happen only during a world crisis? When every human is at risk of fatality? Although this was only seen at the mortgage rate metrics, it gave us a small glimpse into a potentially equitable future for all races, which lies at the core of our existence as equal humans in the same path. 


## Analytical Stage Three 

To complete our analysis, we finally wanted to look at our data on a economic level. The following analysis and graphs is what we derived. 

### Income and Mortgage Rates

1. Are people with higher incomes more likely to get lower mortgage rates during the pandemic? Do higher incomes affect mortgage rates during the pandemic? 

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/gkS3B6D9/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/cr3KvC2T)

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/W44Xk1y7/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/LJrtd22q)


Both visual and statistical analyses confirm that high-income earners had slightly lower mortgage rates compared to other income groups before the pandemic, with lower-middle-income earners facing the highest rates. During the pandemic, rates dropped across all groups and became almost equal, with high-income groups maintaining a slight advantage. Post-pandemic, rates for high-income, upper-middle-income, and low-income groups equalized, while lower-middle-income earners continued to face higher rates. Statistical tests further validated these findings, showing a significant difference in loan rates during the pandemic, with high-income earners benefiting from lower rates (t-statistic: -90.94, p-value: <2.2e-16). Similar differences were observed pre-pandemic, while post-pandemic dynamics shifted, with high-income groups no longer enjoying the lowest rates.


### Loan Approvals in New York State 

2. How did loan applications and approval rates vary across Pre-Pandemic, Pandemic, and Post-Pandemic periods?

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/d1gYfXCz/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/r0G30fQJ)

During the pandemic, loan applications significantly increased, as shown in the plot,  likely due to reduced mortgage rates. Post-pandemic, applications declined to levels below pre-pandemic figures. Approval rates remained consistent across all three periods. Statistical results confirmed these trends, indicating that lower rates during the pandemic likely drove the increased application numbers.


### Jobs and Mortgages Rates, NYC vs State

3. Do certain jobs in a county affect mortgage rates during the pandemic?


[![](https://i.postimg.cc/vmRgp7xK/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/qNLvK3Lc)

This plot reveals that NYC and the ‘Rest of the State’ experienced comparable average loan rates during all periods due to similar distributions of job types. Loan rates dropped significantly during the pandemic and increased post-pandemic.

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/7PBCxrT0/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/jC7qX9cS)

This plot highlights differences among NYC boroughs. Manhattan and Brooklyn, with the highest proportions of "Management, Business, Science, Arts" jobs, consistently experienced lower loan rates compared to other boroughs. Post-pandemic, Manhattan maintained its advantage in rates and job composition.

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/c18Z3xyZ/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/Z0Z1th5D)


The statistical ANOVA test, conducted on the pandemic time period across all counties in New York State, found no significant linear relationship between job type proportions and loan rates. However, visual correlation analyses for all job groups versus average loan rates during the pandemic indicated variations in slopes among different job types. Additionally, specific regression analyses confirmed that the "Management, Business, Science, Arts" job group had a significant negative impact on average loan rates, showing a strong negative correlation across pre-, during, and post-pandemic periods. Furthermore, multivariable regression analysis for the pandemic period revealed that higher proportions of Natural Resources, Construction, Maintenance and Production, Transportation, Material Moving jobs were associated with increased loan rates. These findings suggest that job type proportions within counties do influence average loan rates during 2021.

## Conclusion 

The counties with the higher mean incomes tend to have more total loans while the lower incomes have less, proving income does affect the amount of mortgage loans given. 
The data confirms that White race, followed by Asian and then black/African American have greater mortgage loan types, loan $ and better rates. However there seems to be demand shifts throughout the three stages. More loans were given out during covid and has been decreasing after Covid. 

Income and job types significantly influenced mortgage rates during the pandemic. High-income earners consistently benefited from lower rates, but post-pandemic, rates equalized among groups, with lower-middle-income earners facing higher rates. The "Management, Business, Science, Arts" job group, the largest in New York, was linked to lower rates, while higher proportions of "Natural Resources, Construction, Maintenance" and "Production, Transportation, Material Moving" jobs were associated with higher rates. These findings highlight the interplay between income, employment, and mortgage lending trends before, during, and after the pandemic.
