<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project was taken as inspiration from a YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/CityNerd">City Nerd</a>, who created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl7cprP_6KM">video</a> about the “10 Transit Services That Do Huge Numbers at the Farebox”. <strong>Farebox Recovery</strong> is the fraction of revenues raised from fares instead of taxes.</p>
<p>For this project, we will use data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a> as our primary source. The following tables/reports will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Fare Revenue</a> table, in which we will mostly explore revenue.</li>
<li>The lastest <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> tables, in which we will mostly explore the Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) and Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a> reports, in which we will mostly explore expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use the 2022 verson of all reports, as up-to-date data and newer reports are often uploaded on a lag.</p>
</section>
<section id="getting-started" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>First, we must download, clean, and join the tables.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the code that allowed the immediate download of the data sets did not work for me. So instead, I had to download the data and import it into R, which is seen in my code below.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="task-1-creating-syntatic-names">Task 1: Creating Syntatic Names</h2>
<p>Here, I decided to rename three of the columns in my table, one to remove spaces so it is easier to manipulate in code, and the other to have more common names for easier understanding. Thus, I wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>“UZA Name” to become “Metro_Area”</li>
<li>“UPT” to become “Unlinked_Passenger_Trips”</li>
<li>“VRM” to become “Vehicle Revenue Miles”</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I did this with the following code:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">colnames</span>(USAGE)[<span class="fu">colnames</span>(USAGE) <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="st">"UZA Name"</span>] <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">"Metro_Area"</span></span>

</div>
<p>And then I reloaded my table to see if the columns changed/looked good. They did!</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(DT)</span>

<p>First, I needed to know what the unique codes were used in the Mode column in our data set. To do this, I ran the following command, which produced the following 18 codes:</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/national-transit-database-ntd-glossary">Glossary</a> on the National Transit Database website, I forced search each of these codes to find their corresponding name. Then, I recoded my table to display these names.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Thus, the transit agency that had the most total VRM in our data set was MTA New York City Transit, with a Vehicle Revenue Miles of 10832855350. This makes sense, as public transit easily spans the entirety of New York City, whether it be the subway, buses, the ferry, or more. Since public transit is prevalent in our lives as New Yorkers, with many not even owning their own vehicle and solely relying on public transit, it is understandable that NYC is top of the list.</p>

<p>So, in May 2024, 237383777 unlinked passenger trips were taken on the NYC subway (Heavy Rail). Again, I believe that this checks out, especially with the way many New Yorkers rely on the subway to get around Manhatten during the work day.</p>

</div>
<p>Here, we can see that 296416858 <strong>less</strong> riders used the NYC Subway in April 2020 than April 2019. This makes a lot of sense, as April 2020 was the true start of lock down we faced because of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Whether riders were terrified to leave their homes in fear of contracting the virus or they were listening to the mandate to stay inside unless it is for an emergency, it is not a shock that the MTA had almost 300 million less riders in comparison.</p>
<p>To further prove this point, let’s consider the same comparison, but for May 2019 and May 2020.</p>

<p>The month of May also experienced close to 300 million less riders in May 2020 than May 2019. I am sure if we were to investigate the following months as well, we would come to a similar conclusion. It is truly interesting to see the major impact that the pandemic caused in such a short period of time!</p>

<p>On the busiest day of the year for Vehicle Revenue Miles, New York–Jersey City–Newark, NY–NJ contributed the most with 87400676 miles. However, Decatur, AL contributed the least, with only 25944 miles. The New York–Jersey City–Newark, NY–NJ area providing the most to this list is not shocking, as it is also the leader on the list for total VRM.</p>

<p>When I attempted to run the given code the first time, I discovered that the tables were not joining together with all of their values. I quickly realized that this was because the Modes in the Financial table was still known as their short names. For example, the “Heavy Rail” was still referred to as “HR”. Thus, I ran the same code that we did on the USAGE table earlier to manipulate these codes to reflect their proper names. After this, the table formed with no issue.</p>

<p>Here, we can clearly see that the transit system with the highest farebox recovery is Anaheim Transportation Network with their bus transportation. The fairbox recovery for each transit system is found by dividing their Total Fares by their Expenses. Interestingly enough, Anaheim Transportation Network and their buses have a ratio of .865, which is about a 57% greater than the second place spot, which is the City of Gainesville, FL with their buses!</p>

<p>Similar to the last inquiry , the transit system that has the lowest expenses per UPT is Anaheim Transportation Network with their bus transportation. Their ratio of expenses per UPT is 12.8, which is <em>drastically</em> less than the highest. The highest expense per UPT is Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation and their Cable Cars, with a ratio of 600, which is an extreme difference between the two.</p>

<p>The transit system with the lowest expenses per Vehicle Revenue Miles was Interurban Transit Partnership and their Bus transportation, with an expense of 77.2 per Vehicle Revenue Mile. This is far cheaper than the leader of this category, which is the New York City Department of Transportation and their Ferryboat, with an expense of 771 per vehicle revenue mile. Interestingly enough, out of the ten highest expenses on the list, nine of the most expensive Modes of transportation is the Ferryboat, with only the Cable Car in San Francisco coming in at fourth. This shows that a Ferryboat is most-likely the most expensive transportation mode for transit agencies to run in comparison to its vehicle revenue miles.</p>

<p>The transit system with the highest total fares per vehicle revenue miles is Washington State Ferries, with a ratio of 1120 total fares to one vehicle revenue mile. An interesting correlation to the last inquiry is that the top three highest total fares per VRM belong to ferryboats. Furthermore, the highest value on the list is almost 500% <em>greater</em> than the third value, which is 188, and that percentage only grows as that list goes further down.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In regard to what transit system in the country is the most effective, it depends on which data points you use to weigh your opinion. If you are considering which system has the highest values in URM and UPT, meaning it is the most frequently used, the answer would be the major transit system of NYC’s MTA Transit. Not only is its heavy rail system extremely prevalent in these numbers, which makes sense since numerous rails span the lengths of New York City and are used daily by many, but the NYC MTA Bus also holds rank compared to others.</p>
<p>However, if you are considering which transit system is the most cost effective, it would have to be the Anaheim Transportation Network. Since a high farebox recovery ratio indicates that a transit system is profitable, Anaheim Transportation Network bus’ numbers alone show that this system is highly more profitable than the rest. This agency also leads margin of lowest expenses per unlinked passenger trip, which shows that not only is this system great at making money, it also great at retaining it and not spending the majority of it on expenses. However, while this is great from a business standpoint, as a passenger this transportation agency ranks high on the total fares per vehicle revenue mile scale, as it is in 4th place. This means that this transportation is fairly expensive to ride compared to the others.</p>
<p>In my opinion, I believe that the MTA New York City Transit is the most effective in the country, due to the enormous scale it can run on at a moderate price compared to other agencies.</p>
